/**
 * The "S" in SOLID stands for Single Responsibility Principle (SRP). This principle states that a class or module
 * should have only one reason to change, meaning it should have only one responsibility or focus. In other words,
 * a class should be focused on a single aspect of the system or functionality and not try to handle multiple concerns.
 *
 * Key Points of the Single Responsibility Principle:
 * One Responsibility: Each class should do one thing and do it well. For example, if a class is responsible for
 * managing users, it shouldnâ€™t also handle logging or database operations.
 *
 * One Reason to Change: If a class has more than one responsibility, changes to one aspect of the class can affect
 * other parts, leading to increased complexity and risk of bugs. SRP helps isolate these changes.
 *
 * Separation of Concerns: It encourages breaking down complex systems into smaller, more manageable components.
 * Each component (or class) deals with its specific concern.
